# Speed Reader
---------------
## Objective 
This app utilises [Rapid serial visual presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation), where a sequence of words are shown to the observer at the same location over time. Meanwhile, the average person reads 200-300 words per minute (wpm). Can we read faster if words are shown in the same location, with increasing speeds? (This project is just for fun) 

## Features 
Display words in the same location in increasing speeds.
- From WPM is the initial WPM
- To WPM is the final WPM, and should be greater than from WPM
- Duration is the time taken to increase the WPM to final. The display continues in the final WPM if the full duration has been reached.
